<h2>About me</h2>

<p>

My name is Dominic and I am an indoor cat. I am currently working for the State of Washington, DSHS, Adult Protective Services as a Social Services Specialist while attending a Coding Bootcamp at the University of Washington. In my free time, I love writing and producing music, which is my primary passion in life. I play live shows with my band Fuzzy Math.
