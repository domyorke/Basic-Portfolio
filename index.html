<h2>About me</h2>

<p>

My name is Dominic and I am an indoor cat. In my free time, I love to write, record and produce my own original music, which is my primary passion. I furthermore enjoy videogames, European travel, and literature. 
<br>
<br>
I have five years of experience performing a wide variety of job duties for the state of Washington with: Community Services Division, Division of Child Support, and my current position with Adult Protective Services. As of now, I am enrolled in a UW Coding Bootcamp where I am learning the skills to become a full stack web developer.
